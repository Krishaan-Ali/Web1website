        <h2>Design and Comfort</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="content">
        Apple has prioritized comfort and functionality in the design of the Vision Pro. The headset features a sleek aluminum frame, soft fabric headband, and adjustable straps for a custom fit. Its modular design ensures that users of different face shapes and sizes can wear it comfortably for extended periods.

        <h2>Display Technology</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="content">
        Vision Pro is equipped with two micro-OLED displays, delivering an astounding 23 million pixels combined. This provides ultra-crisp visuals and makes digital content appear as if it's physically present in your environment. Whether you're watching movies or working on a 3D model, the visuals are sharp, immersive, and realistic.

        <h2>Control and Interaction</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="content">
        Unlike traditional devices, the Vision Pro doesn't rely on controllers. Instead, it uses your eyes, hands, and voice to interact with content. This intuitive interface allows you to browse apps, type with a virtual keyboard, and navigate seamlessly with just a glance or gesture.

        <h2>Performance and Processing</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="content">
        The Vision Pro runs on a dual-chip design: the M2 chip handles core computing, while the R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, 5 sensors, and 6 microphones. This architecture ensures a smooth and real-time spatial experience, minimizing lag and maximizing immersion.
    </p>

    <div class="iphone">
        <h2>Use Cases and Applications</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="content">
        Apple envisions the Vision Pro being used for work, entertainment, and communication. Users can set up virtual workspaces, conduct FaceTime calls with life-sized avatars, and enjoy cinematic experiences on virtual screens that feel larger than life. It’s designed for a future where digital and physical realities blend seamlessly.
